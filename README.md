# 🧠 Competitive Programming Problems & Solutions

This repository contains a personal collection of competitive programming problems and their solutions. These are problems I found interesting or challenging while practicing algorithmic problem-solving.

> This project serves as a way to document my learning journey and improve my coding skills through problem-solving in Python and C++.

## 📁 Files

- `meetingline.py` – A Python solution for a line overlap or meeting problem.
- `teamcomposition.py` – A Python solution related to team balancing or optimization.
- `teleporters_hard.cpp` – A C++ solution for an advanced version of a problem involving teleporters or graph traversal.

## 💡 Purpose

- Practice implementing algorithms under constraints.
- Improve problem-solving techniques in Python and C++.
- Build a portfolio of programming challenges tackled independently.

## 📌 Notes

- No external libraries are used.
- Code is written to be readable and self-contained.
- Each file is focused on solving a single problem.
